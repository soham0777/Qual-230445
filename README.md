# Vehicle Surveillance Object Detection

This project is designed for vehicle surveillance using object detection algorithms. The goal is to detect vehicles in real-time video feeds or images and analyze their movement, speed, or any other surveillance-related criteria. This can be used in various applications like traffic monitoring, security surveillance, and fleet management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:


pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage
Running the Object Detection on Images
You can run the object detection model on images to detect vehicles using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python detect_objects.py --input <input_image_path> --output <output_image_path>
Running the Object Detection on Video
To perform vehicle detection on a video feed, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python detect_objects.py --input <input_video_path> --output <output_video_path>
Real-Time Surveillance
For real-time vehicle detection using a webcam or an IP camera:

bash
Copy code
python detect_real_time.py --camera <camera_id_or_url>
Replace <camera_id_or_url> with the camera ID or URL (e.g., for an IP camera).

## Data Preparation
The model needs a dataset of images containing vehicles. The dataset should be labeled for object detection, meaning each vehicle in the image is annotated with a bounding box.

Data Format
The project expects annotations in the following format:

YOLO Format: Each vehicle is labeled with a class and bounding box coordinates.
COCO Format: The dataset includes detailed information about each image (metadata) along with the bounding box annotations.
If you have raw images, use annotation tools like LabelImg or MakeSense.ai to annotate your dataset.

## Model Training
To train the object detection model, follow these steps:

Prepare your training and validation datasets.
Set up the configuration for training (epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc.).
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --train_dir <path_to_train_data> --val_dir <path_to_val_data> --epochs <num_epochs>
You can experiment with different pre-trained models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD) depending on your framework.

## Evaluation
After training the model, evaluate its performance on a test dataset using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --test_dir <path_to_test_data> --weights <path_to_trained_model_weights>
This will generate performance metrics like:

## Precision
Recall
F1-Score
mAP (Mean Average Precision)
You can visualize the results and model's performance using confusion matrices or precision-recall curves.

## Features
Real-time vehicle detection: Detect vehicles in video feeds or webcam streams.
High accuracy: Trained using state-of-the-art object detection algorithms.
Customizable: You can fine-tune the model with your own dataset.
Live Monitoring: Supports integration with IP cameras or video streams.

### Additional Notes:

1. **Requirements File**: Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file to list the necessary dependencies for the project, e.g., `tensorflow`, `opencv`, etc.
   
   Example `requirements.txt`:
   ```plaintext
   tensorflow==2.x
   opencv-python==4.x
   numpy==1.x
   pandas==1.x
   matplotlib==3.x
   scikit-learn==1.x
Scripts: The detect_objects.py, detect_real_time.py, train.py, and evaluate.py files should contain the appropriate code for their respective functions, such as model inference, real-time detection, training, and evaluation.

Customization: Depending on the specific details of your project, such as the object detection model used, data formats, or output types, you might need to modify or extend the README file.
